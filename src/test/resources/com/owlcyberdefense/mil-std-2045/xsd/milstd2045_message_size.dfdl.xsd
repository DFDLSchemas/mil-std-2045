        Real uses of this MIL-STD-2045 will want a definition something like
        below which computes the `message_size_type` value field based on
        the value length of the payload.

        This assumes the payload is a sibling of the header field.
        The header field is 6 levels up from where the message_size
        field appears within it. If your payload field is not named
        this way, and is not adjacent as a sibling field to the header
        then this relative path would need to be adjusted.

        Daffodil's schema compiler will ensure the path is correct or you
        will get a schema definition error at DFDL schema compilation time.
